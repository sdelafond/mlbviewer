Description: Curses interface to the MLB.TV media offering
 A collection of tools to view and listen to streaming baseball games
 from MLB.TV. While the main streaming content is mostly for paid
 MLB.TV subscribers only, there are a significant number of features
 and views available to non-subscribers as well including one free
 game each day. You can watch MLB classic content from YouTube without
 a browser, and MiLB.TV and Postseason.TV are also integrated into the
 same mlbviewer interface.
