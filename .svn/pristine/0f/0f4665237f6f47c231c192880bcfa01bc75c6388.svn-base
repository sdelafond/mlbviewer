See REQUIREMENTS-2015.txt file for 2015 requirements.  This file is mostly
here for quick and dirty summary.
------------

For Linux and other *nixes:

* rtmpdump (http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/) for audio and basic service video
* mlbhls (https://github.com/thegryghost/mlbtv-hls-nexdef/tree/experimental)) for nexdef video
NOTE: The experimental branch of mlbhls is required for mlbviewer:
git clone https://github.com/thegryghost/mlbtv-hls-nexdef.git
* mplayer2 is the recommended player for mlbviewer video streams
* An MLB.TV account (http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/subscriptions/index.jsp)
* For non-subscriber features (highlights and condensed games only), leave
  user= and pass= blank in the ~/.mlb/config file.
* python-gdata is also required for mlbclassics.py and should be available
in the Linux distribution package manager (apt, yum, yast, etc.)

For Windows:

* cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com)
* python
* rtmpdump
* mlbhls
* mplayer or SMPlayer

Installation
------------

For local use:
     python mlbviewer.py from this directory.

If python3 is the system default, use python2:
     python2 mlbviewer.py


Note: Because MLB.TV has changed their service dramatically over the years, 
mlbviewer no longer attempts backwards compatibility.  If it is desired to 
play a previous year's games, please ask in the LQ forum (see README file) to
find out what the last stable release was for that season and instructions
on how to check it out from SVN.

For help, wait for the listings to load and press the 'h' key.

For more information, including configuration file settings, read the README.
