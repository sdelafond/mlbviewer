MLBVIEWER - Making MLB.TV better for Linux since 2008

mlbviewer is a python-based program with a curses interface for connecting
users with the media subscriptions they paid for. 

Most features require an MLB.TV account.

DISCLAIMER:
mlbviewer is intended to be feature compatible with the official MLB.TV 
offering.  It is also developed with the MLB.TV Terms Of Service in mind.  
Feature requests that violate the Terms Of Service (proxy support for 
circumventing blackouts) will be ignored.  Recording of game streams is a 
grey area of the Terms Of Service.  There are ways to use mlbviewer to 
record streams but these will not be documented.


1. MLBVIEWER WIKI

The number of features and settings has grown so large that
documentation has been moved to the Sourceforge wiki at:

http://sourceforge.net/p/mlbviewer/wiki/Home/

There are much more advanced settings and usage documented on the Wiki than can
be listed in a simple README file anymore.  This README should be enough to 
get started but the Wiki will have many more settings and advanced usage 
documentation.

2. CONFIGURATION FILE BASICS

The default configuration file is rather basic.  It is enough to get started
with.  However, there are many more options supported than what is listed in 
the default configuration file.  Refer to the wiki to see a complete list
and explanation of the options.

user=          : MLB.TV or MLB.com username

pass=          : MLB.TV or MLB.com password

Most of the media related features are for MLB.TV subscribers only.  However,
MLB.TV has one free game of the day.  This only requires an MLB.com username
and password.

video_player=  : Video player command (mplayer2 or mpv recommended)

audio_player=  : Gameday Audio player command (mplayer2 or mpv recommended)

use_nexdef=    : Historically, MLB.TV was offered in two video options:
                 Standard Definition (use_nexdef=0) and High Definition  
                 (use_nexdef=1) which required the NexDef plugin if using 
                 the web browser interface.  SD speeds are 300 to 2400 kbps.  
                 HD speeds extend to 4500 kbps.  SD mode requires rtmpdump
                 to retrieve the media and stream it to video_player=. HD
                 mode (or NexDef mode) does not require the NexDef plugin but
                 it does require mlbhls for retrieving the media and streaming
                 to video_player=.  Many users prefer SD mode because rtmpdump
                 starts a stream faster than mlbhls.  However, SD mode is no 
                 longer officially supported by MLB.TV and may go away at
                 some future date.

speed=         : Speed setting is for SD mode and valid speeds are:
                 300, 500, 1200, 1800, 2400

min_bps=       : Minimum speed setting for HD mode
max_bps=       : Maximum speed setting for HD mode
                 Valid speeds for HD mode are:
                 128, 500, 800, 1200, 1800, 2400, 3000, 4500

adaptive_stream= can be set to true (adapative_stream=1) to enable adaptive
bitrate streaming for HD mode.  If adaptive_stream=1, the stream will start
at the min_bps= setting and increase to max_bps= setting if network conditions
support that bitrate.  If network conditions worsen, mlbhls will adapt the 
bitrate to a value between min_bps and max_bps until conditions improve.  If
adaptive_stream=0 (false), the stream will be fixed to the max_bps= rate.

favorite=      : Team code for favorite team.  

Specifying a favorite team unlocks a number of useful features such as:

 - Favorite team is highlighted in listings, scoreboard, and standings
 - Cursor focuses on favorite team in listings and scoreboard
 - Favorite team's media will always be preferred whether home or away (use 
   disable_favorite_follow=1 in config to disable this functionality)
 - RSS and Calendar screens default to favorite team

Team codes for favorite= 

     'ana', 'ari', 'atl', 'bal', 'bos', 'chc', 'cin', 'cle', 'col',
     'cws', 'det', 'mia', 'hou', 'kc', 'la', 'mil', 'min', 'nym',
     'nyy', 'oak', 'phi', 'pit', 'sd', 'sea', 'sf', 'stl', 'tb',
     'tex', 'tor', 'was'

These team codes are also used for calendar and RSS screens as well as the 
mlbplay.py script.

Two flags are necessary for international users to watch live postseason
games:

international=  : True/False, prune out US national listings and display 
                  international stream listing instead

postseason=     : True/False, ignore US blackout statuses to watch
                  international streams

For more configuration file options, refer to the wiki.

3. SCREEN BASICS

mlbviewer is a terminal based application with many screens activated by 
hotkeys.  Some screens contain spoilers such as scores or game results.
Some screens however are designed not to have spoilers.

e      | Media detail view (no spoilers)
m      | Master Scoreboard view (contains spoilers)
b      | Line score for highlighted game (contains spoilers)
x      | Box score for highlighted game (contains spoilers)
C      | Calendar view for favorite team or "C" again to select another team
         (contains spoilers)
t      | Top Plays for highlighted game (contains spoilers)
g      | Standings view 
w      | RSS view
M      | MiLB.tv mode
i      | Jump to inning view (no spoilers)


Action hotkeys

Enter  | Play video for highlighted game or top play
a      | Play Gameday audio for highlighted game
A      | Play alternate audio for highlighted game (use media detail screen
         to see availability of alternate audio)
c      | Play condensed game for highlighted game
s      | Toggle HOME or AWAY coverage
p      | In SD mode, toggle the speed setting.  In HD (NexDef) mode, toggle

stats for that player.  Highlight a team header like "Kansas City Batting" 
and press Enter to see team batting statistics.

4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

mlbviewer tarballs on SourceForge are updated only a few times a season and are
considered stable releases.

Development on mlbviewer is ongoing all season long.  To get current features
and fixes between Sourceforge releases, it is necessary to checkout an 
SVN release.  To use SVN, the subversion package is required.

To checkout an initial copy from SVN:

svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/mlbviewer/code/trunk mlbviewer-svn

To update an SVN copy to the latest revision:

cd mlbviewer-svn
svn up

Discussion about mlbviewer features and bugs is ongoing on a LinuxQuestions.org
forum thread.  Don't worry about the 300+ pages of discussion.  Just post
to the thread and someone will respond within a day or two.

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/fedora-35/mlb.tv-in-linux-432479/

Please read the Sourceforge Wiki pages before posting to the forum to spare
the forum readers from having to answer the same questions over and over again.
